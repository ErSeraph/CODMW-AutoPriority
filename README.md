# CODMW-AutoPriority
A small software that will allow you to stop opening the task manager every time to set the priority of the game to "normal".

## Advantages
By moving the .exe in ```\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp``` folder, every time you boot your PC, a process will start and if the game is opened, every 10 seconds the process priority will be set to "Normal", fixing the game stuttering and mouse lag.

The program is very light and has no impact on the system during his lifecycle.

The first time, you need to double-click or reboot your pc after moving the .exe file to start the process.
